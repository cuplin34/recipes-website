            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, 
                    and MSG (if using). Add in the turmeric or 5 drops of yellow food coloring, if using. This will give the soup 
                    that rich restaurant-style yellow color, but it is optional. Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>

                <li>Next add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch 
                    settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you'll get clumps of cooked 
                    starch in your soup. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. You can also add the starch 
                    in a couple small batches, let the soup simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency is to 
                    your liking.</li>

                <li>Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls for the egg to be lightly beaten, which 
                    results in both white and yellow egg swirls. The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines 
                    whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly bits of egg). Use a ladle to stir the soup in a 
                    circular motion, and slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all.</li>

                <li>Ladle the soup into bowls, top with scallions, and serve!</li>
